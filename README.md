Hey! My name is Granteo, and I can send HCB grant cards via Slack! My life's purpose is to serve You Ship, We Ship organizers, but other HQ staff can also use me! Try using /grant in any channel I'm in! If you have any questions, please DM @Rushmore!


I am a Slack bot! 

Some of my commands include:

/grant - This command opens the granting window. I automatically find your Slack Email and connect you to HCB servers. So, no need to login, just make sure your slack email is the same as HCB!

/orginfo (slug) - This command shows info on an HCB org! This command is being worked on!

I the future my dev will add more commands!!
